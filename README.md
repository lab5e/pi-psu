# pi-psu

This is just a simple server that listens for messages from a Span device and power cycles the device if it hasn't seen any traffic from the device within some time span.

## Deployment

This runs on the host `relay` on the local network.  You can inspect the state at <http://relay:8080/> and trigger a reboot of the connected device at <http://relay:8080/reset>

## Example

Assuming you have set `PI_PSU_TOKEN` to your SPAN API token, and you are using the board Bj√∏rn made with the relay attached to pin 27, the defaults for the other parameters should do.

```shell
pi-psu --collection 566ecm37cmcahj --device 566ecm37cmcahh
```

## Command line options

```shell
$ pi-psu -h
Usage:

      --device=                  Span device ID [$PI_PSU_DEVICE]
      --msg-timeout=             time after last message seen from device to when we power cycle (default: 2m)
